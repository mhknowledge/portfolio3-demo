# portfolio3-demo

## Description

This demo was designed to represent the 3rd phase of what will ultimately become my personal portfolio.  As we progress upon the path of becoming full stack developer, so too will this page progress and improve to where it will acurately showcase my skills and talents.  The intent is to develope the page to a point where is displays and highlights my strongest work as well as the thought process employed throughout their developmental stages.  Thus far, the page displays the implementation of matters that we've covered up this point regarding HTML, basic & advanced CSS, Nodejs, mySQL & handlebarsjs.  From the CSS matters that we've covered consist of headers with links to various sections on the page, navbars, and responsive layouts so that the page properly auto adjust to differenct screen/device requirements for proper display.
